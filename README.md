# Lending_Club_Loan_Prediction

Problem Statement
The data contains loan data for the loans issued and latest payment information. Your aim here is to predict the loan_status (Whether the loan is fully paid or not?)

About the Dataset:
Snapshot of the data you will be working on:

datasnapshot

A zipped file containing the following items is given:

train.csv :
The data file train.csv contains the 131728 instances with the 33 features including the target feature.




test.csv" :
The datafile test.csv contains the 56455instances with the 32 features excluding the target feature.




sample_submission.csv :
Explained under the Submission sub-heading




DataDictionary.csv:
The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the dataset




Lending_Club_Student_Template.ipynb :
A template notebook explaining the task breakdown to solve the given problem statement (Learners are recommended to use it)

Submission
After training the model on train.csv data, the learner has to predict the target feature of the test.csv data using the trained model. The learner has to then submit a csv file with the predicted feature.

Sample submission file(sample_submission.csv) is given to you as a reference to the format expected when you submit

Evaluation metrics
For this particular dataset we are using f1 score as the evaluation metric.

Submissions will be evaluated based on F1 score

Your f1_score score	Points earned for the Task
f1_score>= 0.95	100% of the available points
0.93 <= f1_score < 0.95	80% of the available points
0.90 < f1_score < 0.93	70% of the available points
f1_score <= 0.90	No points earned
Outcomes
The main objective of this task is to provide you with an open field where you can practice and work your way with a dataset end to end without any restrictions from our side. So feel free to play around the model until you arrive at your best solution.

In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Feature Selection Techniques
Logistics Regression
F1 Score Evaluation Metrics


After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a logistics regression model with feature selection technique.

Skills Covered:
Logistic Regression
Data Extraction
correlation plot
sklearn
pandas
